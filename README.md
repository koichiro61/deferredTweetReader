# deferredTweetReader
A twitter reader that fetches tweets by a user with his/her screen name,  keep them for period to defer (predefined in seconds) and then display them on the console after the deferral period. 
You could enjoy games on sports program on DAZN (or other live streaming sevices) and tweets on the game you are watching at the same time WITHOUT knowing the results from the tweets before those happen on your live screen.
API_KEY, API_SECRET, ACCESS_TOKEN and ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET, and 'elavated access' are needed. Get your own on twitter's developer forum.
